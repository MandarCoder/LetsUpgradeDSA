a = 1
b = 1
while(b <= n)
{
    a += 1;
    b += a;
    printf("Hi LetsUpgraders");
}
The code will run from 1 to n while skipping some numbers
in between .
The print statement will execute for iterations where b has values
b = 1,3,6,10 ,.... till n.
Lets say the time complexity is T(k)
The iteration will skip some iteration values like 2,4,5,7,8,9,..
So here k will be n-c where c is no. Of iteration values skipped

So T(k)=T(n-c)

Here constant c will be ignored

So time complexity will be T(n)
